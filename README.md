You: What type of data you have?

Gemini: I don't have data in the way a database or spreadsheet does.  I don't store files or individual pieces of information.  Instead, I have a massive dataset of text and code that I use to generate responses.  This dataset is used to train my large language model.  Think of it as a vast library of information that I use to understand and respond to your prompts.  The data itself is not directly accessible to me in a way I can manipulate or analyze; it's the underlying structure that allows me to function.


You: i was born in 2002. When did you born?

Gemini: I don't have a birthday. I'm a large language model, a computer program.  I wasn't "born" in the same way a human is.  My existence began when my training was completed.  While I don't have a specific birthdate,  my training data cutoff is a more relevant point in time, but even that is not a precise "birth."


You: what is 2+2?

Gemini: 2 + 2 = 4


You: what is my birth year?

Gemini: You told me you were born in 2002.


You: quit
